Start your professional job hunt from the command line!
A Pandas DataFrame keeps track of your application progress

###Getting Started


From the command line:
> ```python -i job_hunt_class.py "init"```  - the first time you run it.
>> ```python -i job_hunt_class.py```  - everytime after that.

From ipython:
> ```run job_hunt_class.py "init"```  - the first time you run it.
>> ```run job_hunt_class.py```  - everytime after that.

This creates the job_hunt object jh.
***Remember to jh.save() before exiting your interactive environment***
